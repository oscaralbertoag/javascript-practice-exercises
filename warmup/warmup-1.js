// WARM UP EXERCISE WORKSHEET 1
// Solve all problems. Sometimes a particular problem may have more than 1 correct answer. 
// Problems can also build on previous problems.

// 1) Create an array (store it in a new variable) and push these numbers to the array: 2,4,6,8,10


// 2) Access the 5th element in the array created in step 1 and store it in a new variable


// 3) Replace the 4th element in the array created in step 1 with the number 27


// 4) Store the array's size in a new variable


// 5) Iterate over the array created in step 1 and print out each element


// 6) Create a new array of size 10 filled with zeroes


// 7) Create a string with your first name and store it in a variable


// 8) Create a string with your last name and store it in a variable


// 9) Concatenate the strings from steps 7 & 8 and store the result in a new variable. Don't forget to add a space between first and last name. Do not use string interpolation.


// 10) Do the same as step 9, but use string interpolation.


// 11) Create a function that takes two strings as arguments (first, last) and and returns a string in the format:
// "Hello, Jon Snow, how are you today?" when first is "Jon" and last is "Snow"


// 12) Create a function that takes two strings as arguments (first, last) and and prints a string in the format:
// "Hello, Jon Snow, how are you today?" when first is "Jon" and last is "Snow"


// 13) Store the length of string "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" in a new variable



// 15) Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum


// 16) Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the difference


// 17) Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the result of dividing the first parameter by the second parameter


// 18) Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the result of multiplying them


// 19) Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the remainder after dividing the first by the second


// 20) Create a function that takes 1 parameter and prints the type of the parameter (e.g. for "hi" it would print "String")


// 21) Create a method that takes 2 numbers as parameters (base & height) and calculates the area of a triangle


// 22) Create a method that takes 2 numbers as parameters (base & height) and calculates the area of a triangle, but this time use the methods created in 17 & 18 to calculate your result


// 23) Create a Map to map a person's name to their age (e.g. "Jon" maps to 23, "Mary" maps to 25, etc). Create at least 5 entries


// 24) Iterate over all elements of the Map from 23 and print a line in the following format for each key-value pair:
// "Key:Mary, Value:25"


// 27) Create an array and add 5 strings. The strings can be whatever you want


// 28) Iterate over the array created in 27 and print each string


// 29) Iterate over the array created in 27 and print each string. Use a while loop to do the iteration


// 30) Create a method that takes 1 parameter and returns a boolean value. It will return true if the parameter is a string, false otherwise

// 31) Create a method that takes 1 parameter and returns a boolean value. It will return true if the parameter is a number, false otherwise


// 32) Create a method that takes 1 boolean parameter called 'hungry' and prints "Not hungry" when the argument is false, and prints "Very hungry" when the argument is true. Use the ternary operator.


// 33) Usa a while loop to print "Are we there yet?!!" 10 times

// 34) Create a method that takes a number as a parameter and uses a while loop to print "Are we there yet?!!" n times, where n is the number of times the statement will be printed. For example, when n = 5, it will print "Are we there yet?!!" five times.


// 35) Create a method that takes two numbers as parameters and calculates the area of a rectangle


// 36) Create a method that takes two numbers as parameters and calculates the area of a rectangle, but this time use the method you created in 18 to perform the calculation


// 37) Given any string, use the ternary operator to print "Yes" or "No" whenever the string contains the letter 'a'
// For example, your statement should print "Yes" for "Hola" and "No" for "Hi"


// 39) Create a method that takes 1 parameter called 'total' (float) , calculates a 20% tip, and returns it.
